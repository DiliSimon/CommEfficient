# CommEfficient
This branch uses Python multiprocessing in a functional implementation of federated learning. 

It comes with two experimental setups; a ResNet9 on CIFAR10 (`fed_train.py`) and GPT2 on ConvAI (`gpt2_train.py`). 

There are a variety of command-line args which are best examined by looking at the argparser for either of the above files. 

All functions are in `functions.py`
